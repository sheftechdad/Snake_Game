# Snake Game

## Overview

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game developed using Python's Tkinter library. The game involves controlling a snake to collect food items while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body. It also keeps track of the player's score, making it engaging and competitive.

## Features

-   Control the snake using the **arrow keys** (Up, Down, Left, Right).
-   **Real-time score tracking** displayed on the screen.
-   The snake grows as it collects food items.
-   The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
-   Simple and visually appealing interface designed with Tkinter.

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x installed on your system.
-   Tkinter library (pre-installed with Python).

## How to Run the Game

1.  Clone this repository or download the source code.
2.  Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3.  Run the following command to start the game:
    
    ```bash
    main.py
    
    ```
    

## How to Play

-   Use the **arrow keys** on your keyboard to move the snake:
    -   **Up Arrow**: Move up
    -   **Down Arrow**: Move down
    -   **Left Arrow**: Move left
    -   **Right Arrow**: Move right
-   Your goal is to collect as many food items as possible. Each food item increases your score and makes the snake longer.
-   Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body, as this will end the game.


## Project Structure

-   **main.py**: Main Python file containing the game logic.


## Game Logic Highlights

-   **Snake Movement**: Controlled using event bindings for the arrow keys.
-   **Score Tracking**: The score is incremented each time the snake collects food.
-   **Collision Detection**:
    -   Game over if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
    -   Food repositioned when eaten.

## Future Improvements

-   Add different difficulty levels.
-   Implement power-ups or obstacles for more challenge.
-   Include a leaderboard to display high scores.
